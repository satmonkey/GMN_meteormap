GMN Meteor Map is a multipurpose trajectory/orbit viewer, based on the data produced by GMN trajectory solver at the UWO, Canada.

Usage:

- Select the date/time or solar longitude span you are interested in and click on Update. Default range is last 3 days
- Review the results and modify your filter as needed
- Orbits are updated with UWO every 2 hours, however you can force the update (2 last daily files) manually by clicking on the "Quick download" button
- If interested in particular sky area, see the radiant plot and then put the window coordinates into x1,x2,y1,y2 filter (of the currently chosen dimeneion)

Using station filter:
Put the stations starting characters, divided by comma

Using shower filter:
Put the shower(s) code (https://www.ta3.sk/IAUC22DB/MDC2022/), divided by comma

Ground plot:
- lines are colored by peak magnitude
- the meteor plot is limited to 10000

Radiant Plot:
- choose dimensions on x, y and z axis
- choose projection
- choose rasterize for large data (currently buggy for Sinusoidal projection)
- you can zoom in/out, pan etc. by using controls in the upper right corner
- points are sized by a peak magnitude
- the orbit plot is limited to 100000

It is advisable to use as much filtering as possible, to avoid data overload in the browser.
